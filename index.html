      <h2>HTML Versions and Key Features</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a standard markup language used to
          create and structure content for the web. It is the foundation of most
          websites and web applications and is used to create the structure and
          layout of a webpage, as well as to add text, images, links, and other
          types of content.
        </li>

        <li>
          HTML is made up of a series of tags and attributes that define the
          structure and content of a webpage. Tags are used to identify
          different types of content on a page, such as headings, paragraphs,
          images, and links. Attributes provide additional information about a
          tag, such as the source of an image or the destination of a link.
        </li>

        <li>
          Web browsers use HTML to display web pages to users. When a user
          requests a webpage, the browser sends a request to the web server,
          which responds with an HTML document. The browser then processes the
          HTML and renders the page to the user.
        </li>

        <li>
          HTML is often used in conjunction with other web technologies, such as
          CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and layout, and JavaScript
          for dynamic interactivity and functionality.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <details>
        <summary>HTML 1.0</summary>

        <h3>
          HTML 1.0 or first version of HTML was a version of SGML that had
          ability to link different document or pages using 'href'. HTML 1.0 had
          20 elements or tags, now latest version of HTML, ie HTML5 has a lot
          more.
        </h3>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>HTML 2.0</summary>

        <h3>
          After HTML 1.0, the second version of HTML was released in 1994. HTML
          2.0 was an expansion of HTML 1.0. Internet Engineering Task Force
          (IETF) was behind it's creation.
        </h3>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>HTML 3.2</summary>

        <h3>
          HTML 3.2 was released In 1997. HTML 3.2 had many new features like
          tables, superscript, subscript etc. Two most important features
          introduced in HTML 3.2 were tables and text flow around images. Tables
          were widely used and programmers still use them but it is not
          recommended anymore. In HTML5 div tags and other semantic elements are
          used more frequently instead of table element.
        </h3>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>HTML 4.01</summary>

        <h3>
          HTML 4.01 was released In 1999. HTML 4.01 introduced features like
          scripting, style sheets, better tables, better forms frames and
          embedding objects. HTML 4.01 was a revised version of HTML 4.0, it
          also included features for the disabled people to enhance their
          interactivity with the Global world through Internet.

      <details>
        <summary>XHTML</summary>

        <h3>
          In 2000 XHTML was released. XHTML stands for Extensible Hyper Text
          Markup Language. XHTML has strict set of rules and it is basically an
          XML application of HTML.
        </h3>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>HTML5</summary>

        <h3>
          So all of this added up and then after so many year HTML5 was released
          in 2014. HTML5 is the best version of HTML up till now. HTML5 improved
          user interactivity so much and also lessened the burden of devices.
          HTML5 fully supports all kind of media application that are there.
          HTML5 supports both audio and video media content. HTML5 also provides
          full support for JavaScript to run in the background.
